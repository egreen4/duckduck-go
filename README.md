# duckduck-go
A model-view-controller project addition to our duck series. 

## Running duckduck-go:
```git
pull indev-mvn
make run
```

# Contributing:
This project makes heavy use of Maven, and as such, we recommend you use an IDE which supports it.

## Fun Part
Once it has loaded press 'Quack' and have the time of your life watching the duck bounce around.
